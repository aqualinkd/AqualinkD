# Legal Disclaimer & Interoperability Notice

This document outlines the legal status and usage terms for the **AqualinkD** project.

---


## 1. Project Status
**AqualinkD** is an independent, open-source software project. It is **not** affiliated with, authorized by, sponsored by, or endorsed by:
* **Zodiac Pool Systems** or **Jandy®**
* **Pentair®** (including Pentair Water Pool and Spa, Inc.)
* Any of their parent companies, subsidiaries, or related brands.

## 2. Reverse Engineering & Interoperability
AqualinkD has been developed for the sole purpose of achieving **hardware interoperability**.
* **Clean Room Implementation:** This project does not contain, use, or redistribute any proprietary source code or binary firmware belonging to Jandy or Pentair. 
* **Protocol Implementation:** The communication methods used by this software (including modifications to the standard Modbus protocol over RS485) are a "method of operation" implemented through independent observation of unencrypted signal sequences. 
* **Legal Precedent:** This work is protected under the principles of **Fair Use** for interoperability (consistent with legal standards established in *Sega v. Accolade* and *Google v. Oracle*). Under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b), copyright protection does not extend to the ideas, systems, or methods of operation defined by a communication protocol.

## 3. Trademarks
All product names, logos, and brands mentioned (such as Jandy®, Aqualink®, Pentair®, IntelliTouch®, or EasyTouch®) are the property of their respective owners. Their use within this project is for **nominative purposes only**—specifically to identify the pool equipment with which this software is compatible. This usage does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by the trademark holders.

## 4. DMCA & Security
AqualinkD does **not** bypass or circumvent any digital rights management (DRM) or effective technological protection measures. The hardware signals being interfaced are unencrypted and transmitted via standard serial communication. This software is intended for use on the owner's private home network.

## 5. Risk & Warranty Disclaimer
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
Interfacing with high-voltage pool equipment and RS485 data buses involves inherent risks. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that:
* This software is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
* The developers are not responsible for any damage to pool equipment, RS485 hardware, or Raspberry Pi/computing devices.
* Use of third-party software may **void your manufacturer's warranty**.
* The developers are not liable for any injury or property damage resulting from the use or misuse of this software.
